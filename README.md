## Overview

If you use Windows 10 operating system, you can select several images or PDF files in one folder, right-click mouse button on the selection, select "print". But there some limitations. In images case changing of printing settings can only be done through "options", "printer properties" in the "Print images" window that opens, and you cannot change the order of files:
it depends on which file you right-clicked first from the selected ones. It is not allowed to set printer setting while print PDF files this way.

This application enables users to combine and print multiple images or PDF files as a single document with customizable settings. The interface is straightforward and user-friendly and allows for easy file selection, configuration, and printing.
