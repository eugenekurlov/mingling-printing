# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to acting in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Guidelines for Participation

We aim to create an open and welcoming space. Hereâ€™s how you can contribute to a supportive environment:

- **Be respectful**: Treat others with kindness, recognizing that everyone brings unique perspectives and skills.
- **Stay constructive**: Offer feedback that is thoughtful and aimed at improvement, not criticism for its own sake.
- **Foster collaboration**: Help others where you can and share knowledge freely.
- **Be patient**: Understand that contributors may have different levels of expertise and time availability.

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- Personal attacks, insults, or discriminatory remarks.
- Harassment of any kind, whether public or private.
- Deliberate disruption of discussions or project processes.
- Sharing private information about others without explicit permission.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for upholding this Code of Conduct. If an issue arises, we will:

1. Investigate the report fairly and thoroughly.
2. Take corrective actions, such as warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal, depending on the severity of the behavior.
3. Provide transparency when actions are taken, while respecting the privacy of those involved.

We are committed to resolving conflicts constructively and maintaining the health of our community.
